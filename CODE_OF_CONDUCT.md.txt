# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Not being a fucking dick
* Not wasting time with emotional bullshit

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Discussing politics, religion, or other irrelevant personal topics
* Private messaging people you disagree with just to be a fucking dick
* Doxxing people and other illegal harassing stalking loser behavior

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for using the banhammer judiciously on people who act like fucking dicks. 

I have the right to remove material that is fucking dickish or ban anyone for being a fucking dick. 

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to everything touching this repository. Don't like it? Don't issue a PR. 

## Enforcement

You'll be removed, blocked, privileges revoked, and -- where warranted -- law enforcement will be contacted. 

Just don't be a fucking dick, okay?
